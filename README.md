# Wik - Quick and easy Wikipedia searches

## Wik makes it quick

With Wik, you have access to all of Wikipedia, in your terminal.
If you have to know something **NOW**, it's as simple as....

 ▶ `wik "wondering"`

Control is important, so a common action like searching is available with `wik -s keyword`.
Once you know the name of a page, type `wik -v "page name"` for a full page view.
To get just a summed up description of a page, run `wik -d "page name"`.
If you ever just want to find a list of entries relating to a keyword, `wik -f topic` will do just that.

## Installation

Pretty easy, you only need to have Ruby installed.

+ `sudo gem install wik`

## Usage

`wik "hello, world!"` - Automatically handle everything
`wik -s keyword` - Search Wikipedia
`wik -f topic` - Find a list of available pages about a topuc
`wik -v "page name"` - View "page name"
`wik -d "page name"` - Get a short description of "page name"
